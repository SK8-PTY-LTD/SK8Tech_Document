Logging in to WordPress

The login page is where you go to access the backend of your website. Once logged in, you can see your dashboard, create new posts and pages, update the theme and add new plugins, as well as make other customizations to your site.

On a typical WordPress site, all you need to do is add /login/ or /admin/ to the end of your site’s URL.

For example:

www.example.com/login/

or

www.example.com/admin/

Both of these URLs will take you to your login page where you can enter your username and password. Once logged in, you will be taken directly to the admin area, or dashboard, of your site.

Logging into a Subdirectory

If your site is installed in a sub-folder, or subdirectory, then you need to add /login/ or /wp-login.php to the end of your site’s URL.

www.example.com/wordpress/login/

or

www.example.com/wordpress/wp-login.php

Logging into a Subdomain

If your WordPress install is on a sub-domain, then you URL will be slightly different:

subdomain.example.com/login/

or

subdomain.example.com/wp-login.php

Directly Accessing the WordPress Admin

Once logged in, you can directly access the admin area of your site using these URLs:

www.example.com/admin/

or

www.example.com/wp-admin/

Both of these URLs check that you are still logged in to your site and redirect to your site’s admin area.
