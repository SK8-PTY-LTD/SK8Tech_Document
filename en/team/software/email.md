In this document, we'll describe how to use our corporate email. Depending on your situation, you might be assigned with an corporate email of one of two domains. 

Every employee must have **at least one** email client setup.

Corporate Email is one of the most widely used communication tool in the world. But here at [SK8Tech](https://sk8.tech), only use email for **two purposes**.

1. Serve as **official communication method** with client
1. **Reset passwords** for other tools

Why not use it for more? Reason is simple, in the world of IM, **Email is simply obsolete**. 

1. For communication, we use [Slack](https://sk8tech.slack.com), see [tutorial](slack.md).
1. For project management, we use [Asana](https://asana.com), see [tutorial](asana.md).
1. For file sharing, we use [SK8Drive](https://drive.sk8.tech), see [tutorial](owncloud.md).
